= rails-engine-generator

Stubs out a new engine plugin. Pass the engine name, either CamelCased or
under_scored, as an argument. Pass --with-generator to add an example
generator also.

This creates a plugin in vendor/plugins including an init.rb and README
as well as standard plugin directories as well as app, config, and db directories.
